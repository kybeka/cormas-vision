## Week 03 – 2025-07-07

### Weekly Focus

**Context:**  
This week marks the return to focused development after [ESUG 2025](https://esug.org/2025-Conference/conf2025.html). Much of the week was spent implementing and expanding on ideas sparked during the conference—thanks to discussions with peers, mentors, and other researchers. This included both technical experimentation and broader project ideation.

### Tasks

- Discuss Planet-C usage details with Christophe.
- Outline the specifications and logistics for obtaining a tripod and a physical Planet-C game.
- Continue labeling the 22k frames of Planet-C gameplay footage.
- As an MVP: deploy a chess detection model (e.g., from Hugging Face) and test it with live streaming (via NDI) from a phone.
- Experiment with computing every 5th/10th/30th frame to evaluate latency vs. efficiency trade-offs.
- Plan how to benchmark the detection model’s performance (speed, accuracy, and stability).
- Draft a shortlist of potential model architectures based on peer feedback.
- Set up a basic experiment tracker (spreadsheet or tool) to log model runs and results.
- Begin organizing ideas for a blog post or internal update summarizing ESUG takeaways relevant to the project.
