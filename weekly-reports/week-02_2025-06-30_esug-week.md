## Week 02 – 2025-06-30
### Weekly Focus

**Context:**  
This week, I am attending [ESUG 2025](https://esug.org/2025-Conference/conf2025.html), so I’ll be focusing primarily on data gathering, project planning, and presentations.

### Tasks

- Prepare a short presentation (~4 minutes) for the “Show Us Your Project” segment at ESUG, introducing the project.
- Further investigate the use of ArUco tags for marker-based detection.
- Collect chess game videos and sample data, with help from other conference participants.
- Start drafting the future webinar presentation.
- Create a `roadmap.md` to outline project milestones and deliverables.
- Research phone-based video streaming options.
- Annotate and label the 22k~ frames of Planet-C footage (or investigate into auto-labelling them)
