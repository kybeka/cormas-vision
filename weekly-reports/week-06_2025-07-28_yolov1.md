## Week 06 – 2025-07-28

### Weekly Focus

**Context:**  
Kicked off the first YOLO round (“v1”) using the closed-loop annotation workflow. Focused on pseudo-labeling, board-aware filtering, and a retrain cycle. Also wrapped up a few planning items before leave.

### Tasks
- Ran inference on the unlabeled pool and generated pseudo-labels.
- Applied **board-aware filtering** (inside-board priority, size/geometry checks, per-class confidence thresholds).
- Retrained **YOLO11-OBB** with a **mixed dataset** (human-labeled + cleaned pseudo-labels)
- Added a minimal run log and standardized folder layout for rounds.

**Still pending:**
- Completed first pass of `roadmap.md`; drafted the webinar outline and slide skeleton.
- Automate the three-bucket split (accept / review / discard) into separate folders.
- Add a simple script to sweep confidence thresholds and export benchmarks for the frozen val set.
