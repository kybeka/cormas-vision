## Week 01 – 2025-06-26  
### Weekly To-Do

**Context:**  
I’ve just finished my university exams this week, so I’m starting the GSoC project slightly later than planned. This week I’m focusing on preparing the project setup and beginning the first explorations.

### Tasks:
- Set up the GitHub repository: Initialized the `cormas-vision` repository, configured the project structure, and connected it to Iceberg in Pharo.
- Gather video data of chess games to explore how a computer vision model could be trained on games similar to those in Cormas.
- Investigate two solutions: one using a computer vision model, and another using ArUco tags for detection.
- Play and record chess games to build a small dataset.
- Splice the Planet C gameplay video into individual frames for analysis.
- Prepare a Cormas seminar presentation to explain the project setup and the planned integration.
